# EasyLingual
> An Interactive Speech Therapy Platform for children with speech & language difficulties</h2>

### What is EasyLinguial?
<hr>

* Web based application for helping children of age 1-10 years having difficulties in speech articulation
* Provides speech therapy in the form of visual, auditory and interative activities
* Also a platform for parents, volunteers, language experts and therapist to help in improving our system (AI)

### Idea
<hr>

#### Children's view

<p>
The children will be able to access the application via modern web browser in any device. The website will contain an interactive shell where animated graphics and synchronized audio will played. The audio played will be the basic language building blocks like alphabets, sounds and basic words and the graphics displayed will be the simulation of tongue for that sound. The application will take feedback in the form of audio as the child repeats, and the graphics and audio will adjust according. Eg: If the child has difficulty in pronouncing 'e' in the word 'elephant', the graphics will focused towards how the 'e' sound is produced and the audio will be changed accordingly. (maybe eeleeephant or something like that).
</p>

#### Volunteer's view
<p>
The volunteers can help in improving the system by recording themselves pronouncing the sounds and alphabets. Our system will provide a platform for recording via webcam and will extract the necessary info. It will then use the data to generate interactive graphics, or improve existing system. Also, the system can learn from language experts and therapist by generating some random graphics initially, but improving gradually under the expert's supervision. 
</p>

<p>
 This will help the system to support multiple languages and provide better feedback to the children.
